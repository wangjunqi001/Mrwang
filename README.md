MrWang's Web server
======
version1 
-------
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Support CGI script and optimization with thread_pool technology,
but CGI script hasn't implemention yet ,and  so far , this project is just for learning servers.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we need to develop the front-end , the 'bootstrap' and CGICC environment is well done.
It's also a long-time study!<br/>

version2
-------
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;add event handler . Recently , I've been learning Redis , add from it's EventLoop , i have an inspiration to change my server's event handler better and better . Now I'm looking forward to do this , comming soon! <br/>
